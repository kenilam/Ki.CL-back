# Patches and version holds

Everything in both repos tracks latest except what is listed here. Each entry
says what blocks it and what to re-check, so these do not quietly become
permanent. Re-check on any dependency sweep.

Frontend keeps its own copy of this file - the two must agree on the shared
singletons (`graphql`, `@apollo/client`, `graphql-ws`, `react`, `react-dom`),
because Module Federation shares them at runtime and a split fails in the
browser rather than at build.

## Patch: `@graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo` 4.4.2

`.yarn/patches/@graphql-codegen-typescript-react-apollo-npm-4.4.2-*.patch`,
applied to both the `esm` and `cjs` builds.

This plugin targets Apollo Client 3 and is unmaintained against 4 - its last
release was April 2026 and its graphql peer still caps at `^16`. Three separate
fixes are needed to make it usable here.

1. **`(node.variableDefinitions ?? []).reduce(...)`** in `_buildHooksJSDoc`.
   graphql 17 leaves `variableDefinitions` `undefined` on an operation with no
   variables, where 16 supplied an empty array, so codegen died with
   `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')`. Four of our
   operations take no variables - `kicl_Me`, `kicl_ExchangeToken`,
   `kicl_RefreshToken`, `kicl_SignOut`.

2. **A `withSuspenseQuery` opt-out.** Suspense hooks were generated
   unconditionally and their overloads are written against Apollo Client 3, so
   they do not typecheck under 4. The option also had to be added to the
   visitor's config whitelist - it builds `this.config` from an explicit list of
   keys, so an unknown option never arrives and the gate silently does nothing.

3. **`BaseMutationOptions` → `MutationHookOptions`.** Apollo Client 4 dropped
   the former. `MutationFunction` is likewise gone, handled by config rather
   than patch (`withMutationFn: false`) since the alias had no consumers.

Two related config changes live in `Codegen/codegen.ts`, not the patch: the
`typescript` plugin was dropped from the `hooks.ts` output because
`typescript-operations` now emits the base types itself and every input, enum
and scalar was being declared twice; and `provider.tsx` no longer parameterises
`ApolloClient`, which is non-generic in Apollo Client 4.

**Symptom if this regresses:** the remote still builds, but its DTS step fails
with `#TYPE-001` and the type archive the Frontend consumes is never
regenerated - so Frontend types silently go stale rather than erroring. Verify
with `yarn workspace @ki-cl/client run build` and check `Client/dist/types.zip`
is rewritten.

**Re-check / migration:** the durable fix is to move the hooks output to the
`client` preset, which is already generating into `Client/src/generated/` and is
Apollo Client 4-native. That would retire this plugin and all three patches. Do
it when there is appetite for updating the Frontend's `useKicl_*` call sites.

## Resolved: TypeScript 7, by moving to Oxlint

Both repos run TypeScript 7.0.2. This was blocked while ESLint was in use -
`typescript-eslint` refuses TS 7 by explicit version check, throwing before any
linting starts, and the documented side-by-side workaround does not work with
this layout: `typescript` is a *peer* dependency of the typescript-eslint
packages, so under Yarn's node-modules linker it resolves to the hoisted root
copy and `resolutions` targeting `@typescript-eslint/*/typescript` are ignored.
Verified, not assumed.

Oxlint does not use the TypeScript compiler API, so the constraint disappears.
The migration was cheap because neither repo used type-aware rules - both
configs were on the plain `recommended` sets, and the only hand-configured
rules were `no-unused-vars` options and `no-namespace: allowDeclarations`.

**What Oxlint does not do:** type-aware rules such as `no-floating-promises`.
`oxlint-tsgolint` is the upstream work for that and is still early. If a
type-aware rule is ever needed, the options are to wait for it or to reintroduce
ESLint for a type-checked subset - which would reintroduce the TS 7 conflict.

**Two rules are deliberately relaxed** in `.oxlintrc.json`, both in the
Frontend:

- `jsx-a11y/prefer-tag-over-role` is off. It wants native elements instead of
  ARIA roles, which is wrong for headless components - Select, Checkbox,
  RadioGroup, Popover, Spinner and Calendar all use roles on non-semantic
  elements by design.
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is a warning, not an error. Several of the
  dependencies it objects to are deliberate and documented - `Context.tsx`
  lists `data` and the lazy result purely as change signals, never reading
  them, which the rule reports as unnecessary.

**Frozen archives are ignored.** `TreeOfLife/v1`-`v14` and `v15-broken` are kept
as references and are not maintained; Oxlint's stricter default rule set found
40 findings in them against 18 in live code.

## Peer warnings that are expected

`yarn install` reports these; they are known and harmless.

- **`graphql` 17 vs `@apollo/server` peer `^16.11.0`** - Apollo Server 5.5.1 is
  the latest and has no 17 range. Verified working: the server boots, and both
  introspection and execution succeed against 17. Re-check when Apollo Server 6
  ships.
- **`graphql` 17 vs `@graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo` peer `^16`** -
  the same package the patch above covers.
- **`graphql` 17 vs `graphql-tag` (via `@apollo/client`) peer `^16.3.0`** -
  Apollo Client 4 itself accepts `^16 || ^17`; only its bundled `graphql-tag`
  lags.

## Ahead of the runtime: `@types/node` 26 on Node 24

`.nvmrc` and `engines` both say Node 24 (24.3.0 locally), but the types are on
26 because the sweep took everything to latest.

This does not fail a build - it is a risk, not a break. The types describe APIs
the running Node does not have, so a call that typechecks can still be
`undefined` at runtime. Nothing in either repo currently uses anything that new,
which is why both typecheck clean.

**Re-check:** either move the runtime to Node 26 and update `.nvmrc`/`engines`
together, or pin the types back to `^24` to match. Whichever, the two should
agree - this is the one place in the sweep where latest and correct differ.
