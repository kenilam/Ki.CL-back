# Patches and version holds

Everything in both repos tracks latest except what is listed here. Each entry
says what blocks it and what to re-check, so these do not quietly become
permanent. Re-check on any dependency sweep.

Frontend keeps its own copy of this file - the two must agree on the shared
singletons (`graphql`, `@apollo/client`, `graphql-ws`, `react`, `react-dom`),
because Module Federation shares them at runtime and a split fails in the
browser rather than at build.

## Resolved: generated hooks, by moving to typed documents

`@graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo` targets Apollo Client 3, is
unmaintained against 4, and caps its graphql peer at `^16`. Keeping it meant a
Yarn patch with three fixes before its output would compile under Apollo 4 and
graphql 17.

Backend `afc8245` dropped it. The `client` preset already generated a typed
document for every operation, and Apollo Client 4 infers result and variable
types from one, so `useQuery(Kicl_TaxonVisualDocument, { variables })` is as
typed as `useKicl_TaxonVisual({ variables })` was. The remote now exports those
documents plus Apollo's hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useLazyQuery`,
`useSubscription`, `skipToken`), and `.yarn/patches` is empty.

The Frontend imports those hooks from `api/provider`, never from
`@apollo/client` directly, so they use the remote's client.

## Resolved: TypeScript 7, by moving to Oxlint

Both repos run TypeScript 7.0.2. This was blocked while ESLint was in use -
`typescript-eslint` refuses TS 7 by explicit version check, throwing before any
linting starts, and the documented side-by-side workaround does not work with
this layout: `typescript` is a *peer* dependency of the typescript-eslint
packages, so under Yarn's node-modules linker it resolves to the hoisted root
copy and `resolutions` targeting `@typescript-eslint/*/typescript` are ignored.
Verified, not assumed.

Oxlint does not use the TypeScript compiler API, so the constraint disappears.
The migration was cheap because neither repo used type-aware rules - both
configs were on the plain `recommended` sets, and the only hand-configured
rules were `no-unused-vars` options and `no-namespace: allowDeclarations`.

**What Oxlint does not do:** type-aware rules such as `no-floating-promises`.
`oxlint-tsgolint` is the upstream work for that and is still early. If a
type-aware rule is ever needed, the options are to wait for it or to reintroduce
ESLint for a type-checked subset - which would reintroduce the TS 7 conflict.

**Two rules are deliberately relaxed** in `.oxlintrc.json`, both in the
Frontend:

- `jsx-a11y/prefer-tag-over-role` is off. It wants native elements instead of
  ARIA roles, which is wrong for headless components - Select, Checkbox,
  RadioGroup, Popover, Spinner and Calendar all use roles on non-semantic
  elements by design.
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is a warning, not an error. Several of the
  dependencies it objects to are deliberate and documented - `Context.tsx`
  lists `data` and the lazy result purely as change signals, never reading
  them, which the rule reports as unnecessary.

**Frozen archives are ignored.** `TreeOfLife/v1`-`v14` and `v15-broken` are kept
as references and are not maintained; Oxlint's stricter default rule set found
40 findings in them against 18 in live code.

## Peer warnings that are expected

`yarn install` reports these; they are known and harmless.

- **`graphql` 17 vs `@apollo/server` peer `^16.11.0`** - Apollo Server 5.5.1 is
  the latest and has no 17 range. Verified working: the server boots, and both
  introspection and execution succeed against 17. Re-check when Apollo Server 6
  ships.
- **`graphql` 17 vs `graphql-tag` (via `@apollo/client`) peer `^16.3.0`** -
  Apollo Client 4 itself accepts `^16 || ^17`; only its bundled `graphql-tag`
  lags.

## Ahead of the runtime: `@types/node` 26 on Node 24

`.nvmrc` and `engines` both say Node 24 (24.3.0 locally), but the types are on
26 because the sweep took everything to latest.

This does not fail a build - it is a risk, not a break. The types describe APIs
the running Node does not have, so a call that typechecks can still be
`undefined` at runtime. Nothing in either repo currently uses anything that new,
which is why both typecheck clean.

**Re-check:** either move the runtime to Node 26 and update `.nvmrc`/`engines`
together, or pin the types back to `^24` to match. Whichever, the two should
agree - this is the one place in the sweep where latest and correct differ.
